Brief description of the problem and data ##\n\nThis project explores the application of deep neural networks for human action recognition (HAR) in video sequences. Human action recognition has a wide range of practical applications, including sports analytics, robotics, and surveillance systems. By leveraging architectures such as CNN+LSTM and 3D Convolutional Networks (C3D), this study aims to compare the effectiveness of different algorithmic designs. Key challenges include modeling long-term temporal dependencies and handling variations in video length, lighting conditions, and resolution.\n\n### Dataset: ####\n* The UCF50 dataset is a collection of video clips of 50 different human action classes, such as Baseball pitch, kayaking, diving, etc to be examine huamn action recogntion with computer vision neural technology.\n* The UCF50 dataset is a reduced dataset containing 50 of original 101 action classes from the the UCF101 action recognition dataset created by University of Central Florida, Center for Research in Computer Vision.
